CSE 2231.01: BugsWorld Project Description</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%" noshade color="#000000">
<p>This quarter you will implement a translator (compiler) for a simple
programming language used to control the behavior of agents in a distributed
simulation (<i>BugsWorld game</i>). Although this language may be a simplified
version of a real programming language, the translation process involves
all the main phases usually found in compilers for full-fledged languages
such as C++ and Java. This project will give you a chance to apply the
ideas and use the components that you have studied so far while learning
the fundamental concepts and techniques used in language processing applications
and implementing several components in this domain.
<h3>
The Game</h3>
<i>BugsWorld</i> is a game derived from the <i>Darwin</i> game invented
by Nick Parlante at Stanford University. It consists of a two-dimensional
rectangular world divided into square cells and populated by bugs. Each
bug belongs to a particular
<i>species</i> and that determines how the
bug behaves. Here is an example of the world.
<center>
<p><img SRC="world.gif" ></center>

<p>Each bug resides in one of the world cells and faces one of the four
compass directions (north, east, south, or west). The basic steps that
a bug can take are: move, turnleft, turnright, infect, and skip.
<i>Move</i>
results in the bug moving to the next cell in the direction it is facing
(unless it is facing a wall or another bug, in which case it does nothing).
<i>Turnleft</i> and <i>turnright</i>, as you might imagine, result in the
bug turning by 90&deg; left (counter-clockwise) or 90&deg; right (clockwise)
respectively. If the bug is facing a cell containing a bug of a different
species, <i>infect</i> results in the other bug being converted to the
species of the infecting bug (otherwise it does nothing). Finally, <i>skip</i>
allows a bug to do nothing for one time step (one turn).
<p>Essentially the BugsWorld game is a simulation of this world and of
the critters in it. You can think of it as a competition among species
where each species represented in the world (by one or more bugs) tries
to survive by avoiding and/or by infecting the bugs of the other species.
<h3>
The Language</h3>
The behavior of (bugs of) a certain species is expressed by a program written
in a simple programming language called BL (Bugs Language). In addition
to the five primitive instructions (move, turnleft, turnright, infect,
and skip), the language provides a couple of selection control structures
(IF-THEN and IF-THEN-ELSE), an iterative control structure (WHILE-DO),
and the ability to define new instructions (INSTRUCTION-IS). Here is a
sample BL program (try to figure out the behavior that creatures of this
species would display).
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROGRAM TryToGuess IS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INSTRUCTION FindObstacle IS
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHILE next-is-empty DO
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END WHILE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END FindObstacle

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BEGIN&nbsp;&nbsp; # TryToGuess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHILE true DO
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FindObstacle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IF next-is-enemy THEN
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; infect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ELSE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IF next-is-wall THEN
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turnleft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ELSE&nbsp;&nbsp; # next-is-friend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END IF
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END IF
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END WHILE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END TryToGuess</pre>
Since you are already familiar with the syntax of a much more complicated
programming language, we won't spend much time describing the details of
the BL language. Here are some of the salient features of the language:
<ul>
<li>
Like all programming languages it has a precise syntax that must be followed
(e.g., all keywords are completely capitalized, and conditions such as
"next-is-wall" use a '-' as word separator and not a '_').</li>

<li>
It is case sensitive (e.g., "PROGRAM" is <i>not</i> the same as "program").</li>

<li>
Control structures (IF and WHILE) must have matching ENDs, and similarly
new instructions must be terminated by END followed by the name of the
instruction (see <i>FindObstacle</i> above).</li>

<li>
White space (i.e., any sequence of spaces, tabs, and newlines) can be used
to format the source program, but it cannot be eliminated completely as
a separator (in part due to the absence of punctuation).</li>

<li>
Comments can be inserted anywhere white space can appear. They start with
the special character '#' and they cover the rest of the line.</li>

<li>
There are 10 conditions that can be tested in IFs and WHILEs, and they
should be self-explanatory. They are: <i>next-is-empty</i>, <i>next-is-not-empty</i>,
<i>next-is-enemy</i>,
<i>next-is-not-enemy</i>,
<i>next-is-friend</i>,
<i>next-is-not-friend</i>,
<i>next-is-wall</i>,
<i>next-is-not-wall</i>,
<i>true
</i>(which,
of course, is always true) and <i>random</i> (which is true 50% of the
time and false the rest).</li>

<li>
Finally, valid identifiers (i.e., the names of the program and of new instructions)
start with a letter ('a'..'z', 'A'..'Z') and can include only letters,
digits ('0'..'9'), and '-' (no '_'). And, of course, you cannot use as
new identifier any keyword, condition, or primitive instruction of the
language.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
The Simulator</h3>
The simulator for the Bugs world is made up of three distinct applications:
server, client, and display (see figure below).
<center>
<p><img SRC="client-server.gif" ></center>

<p>For each simulation there is exactly one server, but there can be multiple
clients (usually at least two) and displays (whenever users want to view
the simulation from different terminals). The <i>server</i> is responsible
for keeping track of the state of the world, for making sure that each
bug gets a fair chance to make progress, and for resolving conflicts when
two or more bugs make conflicting requests (e.g., two bugs that try to
move into the same cell). Each <i>client</i> handles all the bugs of one
particular species (so there will be one client for each species involved
in the simulation). Every time the server tells a client that a certain
bug should get a turn in the simulation, the client executes the corresponding
species' program to determine what that bug's next step should be, and
then sends a request to the server to perform the chosen step on behalf
of the bug. Since neither server nor clients show what's happening in the
world, the <i>display</i> application can be used to view the world during
the simulation.
<p>Note that the server, each of the clients, and each of the displays
can be running on different machines. More details on running these applications
are provided in a separate handout.
<h3>
The Translator</h3>
Since each client handles exactly one species, the client application is
responsible for executing the BL program that determines the behavior of
the corresponding species. However, the client does not execute the species
program in its source form. We first translate the source program into
a more convenient form, and then have the client execute the program in
this "compiled" form. This has several advantages:
<ul>
<li>
The translator can perform all syntactic checks on the source program to
make sure it adheres to the language syntax, and when it does not, the
translator can display useful error messages to facilitate the correction
of the errors.</li>

<li>
It is much more efficient to compile a program once, and then execute it
in its compiled form.</li>

<li>
It is a lot simpler to separate the translation and the execution phases
than directly trying to interpret the source code (especially in this application
where the execution occurs on step at a time).</li>
</ul>
So how does the translator work and what is this "more convenient" form
into which we want to convert the source code? Here is the compiled version
of the sample program <i>TryToGuess</i>: 20 15 20 6 7 0 5 2 12 12 3 5 18
8 17 1 5 18 4 5 0. It is simply a sequence of integers that encodes the
original program in a form that makes execution very simple and fast (though
it makes it very difficult to read!).
<p>The translation process is not a one step process. There are actually
three distinct transformations that we need to perform (see picture below).
<center>
<p><img SRC="translator.gif" width="100%"></center>

<p>The source code can be viewed as a string of characters. The first phase
(<i>tokenizing</i>) breaks up this string of characters into "chunks" called
<i>tokens</i>.
The resulting string of tokens is fed to the parser in the second phase
(<i>parsing</i>). This produces an abstract representation of the original
program. Finally, in the third phase (<i>code generation</i>), the abstract
program is traversed and the string of integers that represents the object
code is generated. The following table shows the results of each transformation.
White space and comment tokens were omitted from the list of tokens since
they are not needed by the following phases. The abstract program probably
will not make much sense at this time. However, it is important to note
that it still contains enough information about the original program for
the code generator to produce the object code and for the program to be
executed.
